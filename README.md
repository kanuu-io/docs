Kanuu is a web application that **handles all your subscription UI** for you.

It provides a beautiful interface for your users to both subscribe to your application and manage their subscription. This is what your customers will see when managing their subscription on Kanuu.

Kanuu uses **your own Paddle account** under the hood. When managing their subscription, your customers will interact with Paddle's modals and therefore you will be notified via webhooks just like you're used to.

All you need to do on your application is add a button somewhere in your application that will securely redirect your customer to Kanuu.
