# 2. Setup Kanuu

First, [click here to register your free Kanuu account](https://kanuu.io/register).

Next, go to your "*Team Settings*" and update your team name. This will be visible to your customers when they manage their subscription on Kanuu.

Under the "*Paddle Account*" section of the same page, you will need to paste the **API key** and "**Vendor ID**" you obtained from Paddle [in the previous step](./setup-paddle).

If you have already created your plans on Paddle, you should now see them selected in the next section.

Otherwise, create them in your Paddle account — under "*Catalog > Subscription Plans*" — and make sure to select them when you come back to Kanuu so they can be visible in the UI. This feature is useful to hide archived plans to your new customers.

Additionally, the next section can be use to customise your URLs.

[In the next step](./create-api-key), we will create an API key you can use to communicate with Kanuu.
